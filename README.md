# Predicition-using-supervised-ML
In this project we want to predict the score of stud"nt given the studies hours.
I used simple linear regression model using Python and the scikit-learn library since we have only 2 variables. 
Here are the 6  main steps for my work's structure :
1- I Imported necessary libraries and kept updating them throughout the project
2-I Prepared the data.
3-Split the data into training and test sets.
4-Trained the linear regression model.
5-Make predictions.
6-Evaluate the model, I used R-squared to evaluate my model, but there are other evaluation metrics that can be used in regression.
